# Classification of Basic Emotions Based on Facial Expressions
* The FER-2013 dataset was used, consisting of facial images divided into seven emotion categories.
* The achieved results provide a foundation for further model improvement, with a particular emphasis on addressing data imbalance and more precise recognition of specific emotions.
* Exploring different architectures and hyperparameters opens up opportunities for potential enhancements in model performance and accuracy.
* As part of the project, an application was developed using the Streamlit library, allowing users to upload their own photos, which are then processed by the saved model to classify the emotions expressed on those faces.
